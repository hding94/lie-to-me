# lie-to-me
My project “Lie to me” has been exhibited in the Future Open Lab Exhibition, which is a project about using technology methods to raise people’s awareness of the identity-shifting in the future. By altering the face images and the recorded speech of the audience, the audience could experience their identities in the digital world might not be as stable and safe as they used to think.
